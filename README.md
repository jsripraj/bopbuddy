# SpotifyBuddy
is a website that allows users to move or delete multiple songs at once from their Spotify playlists. This functionality is missing from the Spotify Web Player and the Spotify Android App, and SpotifyBuddy aims to fill that void.

SpotifyBuddy is currently in Spotify's Development Mode, which means anyone who wants to use it must be added manually.
