# BopBuddy
is a website that allows users to move or delete multiple songs at once from their Spotify playlists. This functionality is missing from the Spotify Web Player and the Spotify Android App, and BopBuddy aims to fill that void.

BopBuddy is currently registered with Spotify in Spotify's Development Mode, which means users must be added manually. Contact me if you'd like to check it out.
